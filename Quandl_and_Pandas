# Combining dataframes:

When combining dataframes, you might have quite a few goals in mind. For example, you may want to "append" to them, 
where you may be adding to the end, basically adding more rows. Or maybe you want to add more columns, like in our case. 
There are four major ways of combining dataframes, which we'll begin covering now. The four major ways are: 
Concatenation, joining, merging, and appending
